This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum.

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. in this game we have used raycasting to build a 3D game using a 2D map in which player can wander though the maze, there are two parts to this project mandatory and bonus part.

in the mandatory part WASD could be used to go forward, bachward, left and right while the left and right buttons could be used to turn to right and left.

in the bonus part using mouse is possible along with WASD for movement and there is replication of human movement in graphics and a mini map to help with directions.

use make to generate an executable and make bonus to generate executable for bonus part(recommended since it is mandatory part + bonus part), the executable takes one argument (map.ber).
